				<h2> College Tours iPhone Application </h2>
			</div>
			<div class="page_content">
				<p> Like many high school juniors, I visited a variety of colleges up and down the eat coast accompanied by my parents. When it came time to apply to schools, however, I couldn't really remember what each college was like </p>
				<p> During an iOS development class in 2011, my friend Josh and I wanted to help solve this problem. We created an app where a student/parent could rate each college on categories such as dorms, food, academics, athletics, social life, college town, etc.  </p>
					<ul class="thumbnails">
						<li class="span3">
							<div class="thumbnail">

								<h3> Rating </h3>
								<p> A simple interface where prospective students could give different aspects of the college ratings as they walked around </p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li class="span3">
							<div class="thumbnail">
								<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}pictures/ctours4.png" alt="">

								<h3> Impression </h3>
								<p>  Gave users the ability to summarize their overall impression of the visit. </p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li class="span3">
							<div class="thumbnail">
								<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}pictures/ctours2.png" alt="">

								<h3> Summary </h3>
								<p> Interactive view to explore ratings of visited colleges</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li class="span3">
							<div class="thumbnail">
								<img src="{{STATIC_URL}}pictures/ctours5.png" alt="">
								<h3> Share </h3>
								<p> One touch share button allowed users to email information about each college to advisors, parents, friends, etc.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
					</ul>
				<p>The app, College Tours, was on free the Apple App Store for a year and recieved well over 10,000 downloads from more then 20 countries. I have future ambitions for the App -- specifically uploading the data to a server so people can see what other people though of the college and data for each college could be aggregated as a whole</p>
