				<h2> Automated Genre Classification Using Machine Learning</h2>

			<div class="page_content">
				<p> For an adaptive robotics class, a couple friends and I thought it would be cool if we could design a system that would teach itself to classify a song's genre given a series of information about the song. The features, exctracted using the <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">echonoest API</a>, include beats-per-minute, duration, loudness, energy, time-signiature, etc. </pi>
				<p> We integrated the last.fm streaming API to select songs from a particular genre. We chose rap, reggae, classical, and country music to test the capabilities of the system. At the time we ran the classifier we had 50 songs from each genre for a total of 200 songs.</p>
				<p>
					The success of the system is generated by the two-layer learning logic. All of the songs and their feature vectors were first sent to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_gas">Growing Neural Gas (GNG)</a> which would minimize difference between songs and cluster them into groups represented by a feature vector. These groups coresponded to different genres. We then passed each song with its own feature vector combined with the feature vector it was associated with in the GNG into a neural network. 
				</p>
				<p> We evaluated the algorithm with several combinations of feature vectors and confidence values from the GNG and ultimately achieved a classification accuracy of 88% with the neural net. </p>
